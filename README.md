# TavernBot - The Ultimate RPG Discord Bot for D&D, Pathfinder, and beyond!
### [Ideas and Suggestions Welcome!](https://github.com/JakeRunsDnD/tavernbot/issues)

The idea: Wouldn't it be hella dope to have a really good D&D bot for discord? I think so. And this is the start of that solution.

TavernBot is a generator bot for Game Masters of D&D. This project is a Discord bot wrapper for the [Dungeonary](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dungeonary), and several other useful discord functions such as roles and eventually music/ambience in a voice channel.

This is currently an 0.x release - I will document features and such here as they're finished up and as we close in on 1.0, but for now, I'm pouring molten free time into this project to try and forge something awesome. Check the code for now if you want to know more.

Below is a sort of notepad, and generally contains nothing useful. If you have ideas or features that you think this bot should support, [let me know on Github](https://github.com/JakeRunsDnD/tavernbot/issues) and we'll get it prioritized :D

Autoreload complete! Putting this here to commit the fix :)

#### Additional Notes:Discord Bot Thoughts and Ideas
Throttle max rolls to 100. If more, mutiply to match and throw another 100 on it.
Cap dice types at 5 instances of 'd'? "Error: Too complex"?
I want to roll this '1d20 + 5, 2d6 + 2d8 + 3'

Voice API https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/topics/voice

Character stats implementations
- PHB spread w/stat priority per class
- 4d6k3
- Colville method
- 6 + 2d6

Keep last 128 macros? 256?

Find a good base of Character Sheet JSON
